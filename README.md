A beginner project for me.

This is a game where the user has to try and guess all 50 U.S states. As the user enters correct guesses, the state name will be displayed on the relevant geographic location on the map.

I used the Turtle and Pandas packages to help create this game.

On exit, a csv file will be saved which shows the states the user missed, to help improve their memory so they can guess more states next time.
